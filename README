Sun Crypto Accelerator 6000 Driver/Kernel Module Source
=======================================================

The source files distributed here will allow you to build the Sun Crypto
Accelerator 6000 drivers and associated kernel modules.  The most common
scenario for using these source files to build drivers is that you are
running an updated or patched kernel that is a different version than the
kernel the drivers in the sun-sca6000-1.1-1.<ARCH>.rpm were built against.
If this is the case, the drivers packaged in the RPM will not load correctly.
Building and installing drivers built from this source tar file will
correct this problem.  The following are requirements for building and
using the drivers:

1. You must be running a 2.6 Linux kernel.
2. You must have the Sun Crypto Accelerator 6000 RPMs installed on
   your system.

Steps to build the drivers:

1. Untar the driver source package into a directory that you have access to
   (preferably as a non-root user).
	$ tar xvfz sun-sca6000drvsrc-1.1.tar.gz
   This will create a directory called "sun-sca6000drvsrc-1.1" which
   contains all the source files and Makefiles.

2. Change directories to sun-sca6000drvsrc-1.1
	$ cd sun-sca6000drvsrc-1.1

3. Run "make"

4. Become root on the system and run "make install"

After step 4, the drivers will be placed in /opt/sun/sca6000/bin/drv, right
next to the drivers that were packaged with the original RPMs.  The
mca_load, mca_unload, scaf_load and scaf_unload, all called by
/etc/init.d/sca, use uname -r to detect the correct driver filename to load
and will pick up your new installed drivers when you do "/etc/init.d/sca
start"
